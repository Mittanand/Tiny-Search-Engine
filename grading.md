# Lab 5 Grading 

## Makefiles 13/13

nice work!!!

## Git repo requirements 2/5

-3 lab5submit did not include updated code

## Documentation & testing 16/17

-1 README should have some more info, for example exit codes, IMPLEMENTATION should have info about each function

## Coding Style 20/20

nice work! try using assertp instead of checking null, it's easier!

## Functionality 34/35

-1 isCrawlerDirectory does not properly check if directory was created by crawler - results in saying directories that were created by crawler were not (but everythign works well when commenting this check out)

## Memory leaks 10/10

no memory leaks!

## Grade: 95
